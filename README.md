## Things to Note in terms of design
  * The design was rushed and there was a lack of though put into what exactly the gallery looks like, as a result, the gallery does not have enough to visually separate it from the gallery next to it
  * Action area belongs in a different place, and it doesn't feel immediately intuitive, nor does using clicks and alt clicks to split images feel natural
  * The grid is not flexible enough (resizing causes problems in the display)
  * Images can look strange in the current sizing of the gallery cards
